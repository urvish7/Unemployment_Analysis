# Unemployment_Analysis

## Project Brief
Using the the data set that we currently have we will do the analysis of the unemployment data using the Power BI , will make some dashboards and check on the data patterns.

## Dataset

The Data set has the columns : Age, Gender, Period and Unemployed.

Now as the dates are not in the format the way we want so we will add a column which will be named Months and then combine that Month to the year for better understanding. Also, we will change the numeric value of the month to the words.
